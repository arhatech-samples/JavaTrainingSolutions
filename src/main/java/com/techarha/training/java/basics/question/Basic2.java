 *@explaination1 NA
 *
 *@question2 Show that hex and octal notations work with long values. Use Long.toBinaryString( ) to display the results (TIJ-4 (8))
 *@explaination2 create a long variable inside main and assign it some hexadecimal value and try printing it.
 *
 *@question3 Display the largest and smallest numbers for both float and double exponential notation(TIJ-4 (9))
 *@explaination3 create float and double variable and use exponential notation to assign them values(ex: 1e-43f is same as 1*10toPower(-43))
